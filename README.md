# Java Neural Network

A small neural network I coded from scratch in Java!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmiller402/NeuralNetwork.git
```
2. Import it into IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE
3. Run the Main file

## Usage

Run the Main file to draw digits and have the most accurate model guess them! You can create more MNIST-trained models by running
